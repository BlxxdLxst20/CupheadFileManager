## Use
This program has to be downloaded on a Windows machine, and then run by double clicking on the `CupheadFileManager.bat` file in File Explorer or on the user's Desktop. 
After running the file, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen or some equivalent antivirus program may appear and warn the user that `Running this app might put your PC at risk.` which may be ignored, as this program only intends to change the name of a singular directory.

The folder named `Cuphead` that can be found when going on Steam and selecting `Browse local files` must already have the correct BepInEx version of Debug Mode configured in order for this program to work.

### Naming Convention
The lines of code using the words `Mods` can be changed to whatever the user desires, but that is just a simple placeholder for the time being.
